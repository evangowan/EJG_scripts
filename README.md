Scientific scripts by Evan J. Gowan

This repository contains scripts that create plots and simple analysis for my work that don't fit into a more overarching repository. If you look in the "papers" folder, you will find scripts that are specific to papers that I have been involved with. To look at the papers I have been involved with, see my [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=lMhyQ1EAAAAJ&hl=en).
