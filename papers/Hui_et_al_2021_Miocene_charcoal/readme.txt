This folder contains some scripts used to do Loess smoothing on the Miocene proxy data found in the paper. It also creates plots of Figure 4 and Figure 5  used in the paper.

Requires Python 3, Generic Mapping Tools

Python modules that are needed:

pandas, statsmodels, scikit-misc, numpy


Run the python3 scripts first to generate the Loess smoothing curves, then run the bash scripts to create the figures.
